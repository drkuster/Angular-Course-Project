Are you an aspiring chef? A professional? Maybe just an Air Fryer wizard? Well I've got the site for you. Meet Chef HQ - your new cooking pal. Chef HQ allows you centralize all of your cooking needs from your recipes to your grocery list. You can create new recipes with custom ingredients and then directly add those items to your grocery list! How cool is that? It gets better: you can also create your own grocery list independent of your recipes.. woah.

In all seriousness, this is the course project associated with Maximillian Schwarzmuller's The Complete Angular Guide course on Udemy. Its functionality is somewhat limited but it employs a lot of core Angular concepts vital for development. This project was built using Angular 10 and Bootstrap for styling.
